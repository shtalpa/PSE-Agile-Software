"Where's my water?" is a prototype developed to address Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) : Clean Water and Sanitation. 
The "Where's my water?" project focuses on improving student access to clean, filtered water by providing a localised map of water refill stations around campus and a real-time reporting system for water quality and facility maintenance. 
Aim: to ease access to water,encourage reusable bottles while reducing reliance on single use plastics like plastic mineral bottles, and foster a culture of sustainability among students.
